This immersive program combines a spring pre-course at Goucher College with a three-week summer study abroad in Germany. Climate change is a complex global challenge demanding multidimensional solutions. In this study abroad experience, students conduct independent research through hands-on air quality measurements, policy consideration, and comparative data workflows to contrast U.S. and German/European trends.  Students will explore the interplay of air quality, climate-change mitigation, and sustainable practices. Cultural immersion by visits to historic landmarks and within local communities will reveal how Germany’s history and values shape environmental policy and sustainable living.

## Detailed Course Overview

This ICA comprises a spring pre-program course at Goucher and a three-week field experience in Germany. In the pre-program, you’ll  strengthen you knowledge of  Germany’s history and current sustainability initiatives.. You’ll examine the science of climate change and the greenhouse effect, confidently collect air-quality measurements using PocketLab Air handheld devices, and master online databases for retrieving and analyzing pollution data. Working in small teams, you’ll research the Bremen, Kiel, Hamburg, and Munich regions—strengthening cohort connections, deepening your cultural understanding, and helping to shape the field itinerary.
Your three-week international experience in Germany begins in Hamburg, where you'll spend five days exploring Northern Germany through a mix of site visits and local excursions. Upon arrival, you'll collect air quality data in various communities and examine the policy and economic dimensions of sustainable practices in the region. Key site visits include the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) and the German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA). Additional day trips will take you to the Universum science center in Bremen and the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel.

After departing Hamburg, you'll head south to your second home base in Munich. The program begins there with a guided city tour and an orientation at EF Tours’ Munich campus, followed by a culture and language workshop. In Munich, you'll continue collecting air quality data using PocketLab Air sensors while investigating sustainability practices across the Bavarian region. Classroom sessions provide space to work in teams, analyze your experimental results, and compare them with international datasets. You’ll also visit environmental research institutions, science centers and industrial locations, including the BIOTOPIA Lab, Deutsches Museum, BMW factory, and Technical University of Munich . Each day in Munich blends coursework, fieldwork, classroom study, and site visits, with cultural immersion through excursions to local landmarks and attractions. Throughout the program, you'll complete academic assignments and maintain a daily reflective journal. The experience concludes with a collaborative group presentation combining your air quality findings with research on climate change policies and sustainability practices in both the U.S. and Germany.

## Learning Objectives

-	Know the sources and chemical processes of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and key pollutants (ozone, particulate matter (PM)).
-	Operate PocketLab Air handheld detectors to measure carbon dioxide (CO₂), ozone (O₃), PM, and Air Quality Index (AQI).
-	Demonstrate basic statistical analysis techniques through the Process, analyisis andze, and interpretion of experimental air quality data.
-	Preserve your own data in a long-term repository and discuss the key characteristics of data preservation and reuse  
-	Connect data preservation and open access to the broader goals of long-term climate monitoring and environmental preservation
-	Acquire and analyze air-quality supplementary data from online resources.
-	Evaluate German scientific, regulatory, and economic approaches to climate change through field visits to research centers and industry or via guest presenters.
-	Analyze how German culture and/or societal values influence environmental policymaking and sustainable practices, integrating these insights into comparative assessments of U.S. and German approaches.
